Use-case:
Tracks overall activity and intensity of motion in specific regions.

What it gives you:

Instantaneous activity detection

Segmentation of active motion regions

Measure of motion intensity and abrupt changes

Recommended Techniques:

Frame differencing

What it gives you:

Joint angle measurements

Limb velocities and accelerations

Detailed biomechanical metrics

Recommended Techniques:

OpenPose

MediaPipe Pose

HRNet or AlphaPose

4. Event-based (Neuromorphic) Camera Simulation
Concept:
Even if you don't have an actual event-based camera, you can simulate a neuromorphic sensorâ€™s behavior using traditional video streams by measuring intensity changes rapidly.

What it gives you:

Precise motion timing with sub-frame-level accuracy

Effective temporal resolution enhancement

Recommended Approach:

Generate "events" by thresholding rapid pixel intensity changes.

Track patterns of event-spikes for detailed kinetic analysis.

5. Texture and Gradient-based Analysis
Use-case:
Analyze muscle contraction visibility, texture deformation, and changes in skin tension.

What it gives you:

Detection of subtle, quick muscular contractions

Biomechanical insights (muscle tension, stiffness)

Recommended Techniques:

Gabor filters

Gradient-based edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Scharr)

Texture metrics (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, LBP)

6. Frequency Domain Analysis (Fourier transforms)
Use-case:
Identify repetitive human movements (e.g., gait analysis, tremors, rhythmic activities).

What it gives you:

Cyclic patterns identification

Movement frequency quantification

Detection of anomalies or irregularities in repetitive motions

Recommended Techniques:

FFT-based analysis

Spectrograms of pixel intensity variations

7. Shadow and Illumination Analysis
Use-case:
When controlled lighting can reveal additional depth or subtle motion not directly visible.

What it gives you:

Additional spatial cues from shadow movement

Enhanced 3D-like perception without depth sensors

Recommended Approach:

Identify moving shadows and correlate shadow displacement with object motion
